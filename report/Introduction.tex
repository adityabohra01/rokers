\section{What is Rokers ?}
In today's world, music streaming has become an integral part of our daily lives. We all have our favorite music and playlists that we love listening to. However, the traditional way of listening to music through CDs or MP3 players has become outdated. With the advent of music streaming platforms, it has become easier to access music from anywhere and at any time. But, what if you could listen to your favorite music through an inbuilt speaker connected to the internet and controlled by your smartphone? This is where Rokers comes in.

Rokers is a music streaming system that allows users to play music from their smartphone through an inbuilt speaker. The system is connected to the internet, which enables users to access music from various online platforms such as Spotify. The system fetches music information from Spotify API and stores it in a MySQL database, which is used to keep records of music playback. The system then fetches actual music from other online sources and Plays it on the local system . Thus eliminating the need for storing music on the local system drive. It also helps to keep the mobile free therefore it can be used separate from the speaker without worrying about range and capacity.

\section{Description Of Tools And Technologies}

\subsection{HTML}
Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web. Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render them into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects, such as interactive forms, may be embedded into the rendered page. It provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. Tags such as <img /> and <input /> introduce content into the page directly. Others such as <p>...</p> surround and provide information about document text and may include other tags as sub-elements. Browsers do not display the HTML tags, but use them to interpret the content of the page.
HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript which affect the behavior and content of web pages. Inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 

\subsection{Javascript}
JavaScript, often abbreviated as JS, is a high-level, interpreted programming language. It is a language which is also characterized as dynamic, weakly typed, prototype-based and multi-paradigm.

Alongside HTML and CSS, JavaScript is one of the three core technologies of the World Wide Web. JavaScript enables interactive web pages and this is an essential part of web applications. The vast majority of websites use it, and all major web browsers have a dedicated JavaScript engine to execute it.

As a multi-paradigm language, JavaScript supports event-driven, functional, and imperative (including object-oriented and prototype-based) programming styles. It has an API for working with text, arrays, dates, regular expressions, and basic manipulation of the DOM, but the language itself does not include any I/O, such as networking, storage, or graphics facilities, relying for these upon the host environment in which it is embedded.

Initially only implemented client-side in web browsers, JavaScript engines are now embedded in many other types of host software, including server-side in web servers and databases, and in non-web programs such as word processors and PDF software, and in runtime environments that make JavaScript available for writing mobile and desktop applications, including desktop widgets.

Although there are strong outward similarities between JavaScript and Java, including language name, syntax, and respective standard libraries, the two languages are distinct and differ greatly in design; JavaScript was influenced by programming languages such as Self and Scheme.

\subsection{MySQL}
MySQL is a free and open-source relational database management system (RDBMS) that is widely used in web applications. It is developed, distributed, and supported by Oracle Corporation.
MySQL is known for its speed, reliability, and flexibility. It is used by many large websites and applications, including WordPress, Drupal, and Wikipedia.
MySQL stores data in tables and uses structured query language (SQL) to access and manipulate the data. It can handle very large amounts of data and can be used on many different operating systems, including Windows, Linux, and macOS.
There are many tools and libraries available for interacting with MySQL from various programming languages, including PHP, Python, and Java. This makes it easy to integrate MySQL into web-based applications.
